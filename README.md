-- TaskApp --
A ToDo app I made when learning Kotlin for the first time. It was meant to help both individuals and small teams to organize time in ordder to reach their goals. 
This application uses Jetpack Compose, and incorporates a dependency injection with Hilt; Room and Firebase were used as local and cloud databases.

- An offline part is mainly done and lets a user to create personal tasks(or ToDos) that can include their own small subtasks, set a deadlines and choose a priority for mentioned ToDos. 
- An online part in not finished yet, although already has some functionality. For example, unlike the offline part, this one requires a user to log in using Google account, and create tasks visible only to certain group of people(in progress).
